# dubbing_english_to_assamese
A pipeline to dub english videos to assamese.


In the ipynb file, the fastapi implementation is there. For that you will need the frontend.
After running the fastapi code, a link will be generated using ngrok, copy that link and paste it in the frontend code.
In the frontend code, assign the variable API_URL with the newly generated link. 

To run get the output without the use of frontend, click on the link, click visit, in the url, just add "/docs" to get the UI, there you will get methods where you can input the English video and execute to get the download link.

Note: Run the ipynb file on Kaagle with P100 accelerator.... More on this is in the ipynb file.....
